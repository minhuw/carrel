# VS Code Release Sanity Check Tests

## Overview

Automated end-to-end release sanity tests for published VS Code builds.
These tests verify critical functionality across different platforms and installation methods,
ensuring that published builds meet quality standards before reaching end users.

See [Sanity Check wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Sanity-Check) for more details on sanity testing.

## Usage

Many tests will use the underlying platform to install and verify basic VS Code functionality.
Such tests will need to be run on the corresponding target OS/virtual machine and will fail if ran outside.
Use -g or -f command-line options to filter tests to match the host platform.

### Command-Line Options

|Option|Alias|Description|

|`--no-signing-check`||Skip Authenticode and codesign signature checks|
|`--no-headless`||Run tests with a visible UI (desktop tests only)|
|`--no-detection`||Enable all tests regardless of platform and skip executable runs|
|`--grep <pattern>`|`-g`|Only run tests matching the given pattern (Mocha grep)|

|`--verbose`|`-v`|Enable verbose logging|
|`--help`|`-h`|Show this help message|

### Failure Logs

When a desktop UI test fails, the app is closed and VS Code's own process logs (main, shared process, renderer, extension host, pty host, agent host and network) are copied from the test's throwaway profile into `<screenshots-dir>/<test>-logs`, so they are uploaded with the screenshots. Each file keeps its last 2 MB, up to 10 MB per test, and extension output logs are not copied. The desktop app also runs with `--log-net-log`, and the gzipped Chromium NetLog is saved as `<test>-netlog.json.gz` (open it in the [NetLog viewer](https://netlog-viewer.appspot.com/)). Treat the screenshots directory as internal.

When installing the extension from the Marketplace fails in any UI test, `<test>-gallery.json` lists the app's gallery requests that failed or returned an error status. Each failed URL is also requested once from the test's Node process, with the same request headers, as soon as it fails, and that response's status and headers are saved next to it. The CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) that the app sends first is replayed with curl too, directly and, for desktop tests, through the proxy that the app resolved for the URL, and the start of each raw response is saved. This tells a Marketplace, CDN or proxy response apart from a failure in the app's own request.

### Example

To run CLI tests for all platforms on given commit of Insiders build, from the root directory run:

```bash
pnpm run sanity-test --commit 19228f26df517fecbfda96c20956f7c521e072be --quality insider -g "cli*"
```

### Testing Unpublished Builds

By default targets are resolved through `update.code.visualstudio.com`, which only serves published
builds. Validation builds that never publish can be tested by
passing `--artifacts-dir`, which resolves each target from downloaded build pipeline artifacts laid out
as `<artifacts-dir>/<artifact-name>/<file>`:

```bash
pnpm run sanity-test --commit <commit> --quality insider --artifacts-dir /tmp/artifacts -g "linux.*x64"
```

Every target has a `targetArtifacts` mapping in `src/context.ts`; an unmapped target fails with an
explicit error rather than falling back to the update service, so runs must be scoped with `-g`/`-f`
to the artifacts that were actually downloaded. The SHA-256 check is skipped in this mode because
there is no update service metadata to compare against.

Server-web previews also require the tested commit's webview bootstrap assets on the CDN; downloading the server archive alone is not sufficient. Pipeline artifact-sanity runs selecting server-web targets must use `VSCODE_BUILD_TYPE=Product` and explicitly set `VSCODE_BUILD_WEB=true`. Invalid configurations are rejected during template expansion, and artifact-sanity stages wait for Web to finish. ARM32-only runs, which do not run server-web, do not require Web. **The Web stage uploads to the shared CDN even with `VSCODE_PUBLISH=false`**; that flag controls product publishing, not webview asset preparation. Do not substitute assets from another commit to make a run green.

### Timeouts

The UI tests open a Markdown preview and wait up to one minute for its webview to render, then up to one minute for its document to finish loading. Resource monitoring remains active through document loading so delayed script failures are also detected. This catches webview resource loading failures (for example 401 responses for remote authorities with uppercase letters such as `wsl+Ubuntu`), and any webview resource response with an error status fails the test. Browsers that refuse to register the webview service worker (such as Chromium on Debian 12) cannot load any webview, so the check is skipped there with a pipeline warning.

HTTP errors and failed requests for CDN webview bootstrap files also interrupt the render/load wait immediately. A `Webview fatal error:` console message interrupts the wait too, including service-worker installation failures that page network listeners do not observe; it does not add a failed resource, preserving the unsupported-browser skip above. Failure messages include status, URL (without credentials/query/fragment), frame URLs, console errors and page errors, rather than reporting only a heading timeout. Newly attached frames without a URL use a fixed placeholder so formatting cannot mask the original failure. A missing bootstrap asset is a failure, not a reason to skip the preview check or increase its timeout.

Synchronous `wsl` commands issued by the tests, and the Ubuntu import, startup, conversion and listing commands in the Windows setup script, have a five-minute timeout. The setup wrapper normalizes nonzero exit codes (including `-1`) to `1` so batch error checks detect them. Setup emits a pipeline warning when Ubuntu cannot run. On x64, setup first installs the pinned WSL release, including its WSL2 kernel.

Extension installation makes at most three attempts, each allowing 30 seconds to click Install, 30 seconds for installation to start, and one minute to wait for completion, with a five-second delay between attempts. These waits total at most 6 minutes 10 seconds, leaving room for setup, the Markdown preview check and cleanup within the default ten-minute test timeout. Mocha does not cancel timed-out async tests, so increasing these waits can cause a retry to start before the previous attempt has cleaned up.

## Scripts

Platform-specific scripts are provided in the `scripts/` directory to set up the environment and run tests:

|Script|Platform|Description|
|--------|----------|-------------|
|`run-win32.cmd`|Windows|On x64, installs the WSL release pinned in `build/checksums/wsl.txt` and imports Ubuntu into WSL2, then runs tests using Edge as the Playwright browser|
|`run-macOS.sh`|macOS|Installs Playwright WebKit and runs tests|
|`run-ubuntu.sh`|Ubuntu|Sets up X11, Chromium, and Snap daemon, then runs tests|
|`run-docker.sh`|Linux (Docker)|Pulls a prebuilt image and runs tests inside a Docker container|
|`run-docker.cmd`|Windows (Docker)|Windows wrapper for Docker-based Linux tests|

### Docker Script Options

The `run-docker.sh` script accepts the following options:

|Option|Description|
|--------|-------------|
|`--container <name>`|Supported image name (required, e.g., "ubuntu-24", "debian-13", "alpine")|
|`--arch <arch>`|Target architecture: amd64, arm64, or arm (default: amd64)|

All other arguments are passed through to the sanity test runner.

## Containers

Docker container definitions and their supported architecture matrix are maintained in [vscode-linux-build-agent](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-linux-build-agent/tree/main/sanity-tests). The `containers/entrypoint.sh` script runs inside those prebuilt images from `vscodehub.azurecr.io/vscode-linux-build-agent/sanity-tests`:

|Container|Base Image|Description|
|-----------|------------|-------------|
|`alpine`|Alpine 3.22|Alpine Linux with musl libc|
|`centos`|CentOS Stream 9|RHEL-compatible distribution|
|`debian-12`|Debian 12 (Bookworm)|Previous Debian stable|
|`debian-13`|Debian 13 (Trixie)|Current Debian stable|
|`fedora-42`|Fedora 42|RPM-based distribution|
|`fedora-43`|Fedora 43|RPM-based distribution|
|`opensuse`|openSUSE Leap 16.0|SUSE-based enterprise distribution|
|`redhat`|Red Hat UBI 9|Red Hat Universal Base Image|
|`ubuntu-22`|Ubuntu 22.04|Debian-based LTS distribution|
|`ubuntu-24`|Ubuntu 24.04|Debian-based LTS distribution|

Each container includes:

- Node.js 22.x runtime
- X11 server (Xvfb) for headless desktop testing
- D-Bus for desktop integration
- Architecture-specific VS Code dependencies

Some containers include web browser used for validating web server targets.

### Running Tests in a Container

```bash
# Ubuntu 24.04 on amd64
./scripts/run-docker.sh --container ubuntu-24 -c <commit> -q insider

# Alpine on arm64
./scripts/run-docker.sh --container alpine --arch arm64 -c <commit> -q stable
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

Sanity tests run in Azure Pipelines via the `product-sanity-tests.yml` pipeline.

Linux x64 and ARM64 builds receive a separate container only DEB/RPM desktop pass whether they are published or resolved from build artifacts. It checks the installed `chrome-sandbox` ownership and mode, then exercises the UI with `--disable-namespace-sandbox` to force Chromium's setuid sandbox. Published runs select both package formats; artifact backed runs select only the DEB/RPM formats included in the job's downloads and use the same `--artifacts-dir` as the normal sanity pass. Native host, Alpine, ARM32, and archive only artifact jobs do not run this additional pass. Both passes publish separate JUnit results.

The dedicated container pass grants `SYS_ADMIN` so the setuid helper can create its PID/network namespaces, and runs the test runner as a non-root `sanity` user. The images must include `sudo`, `useradd`, and `runuser`; missing prerequisites fail explicitly rather than installing packages at test startup. The entrypoint allows that user to invoke only `dpkg` and `rpm` as root for package installation/removal. These changes apply only to the disposable setuid test container; running as root would cause Playwright to inject `--no-sandbox` and bypass the check.

Artifact sanity runs retain the native x64 job for Snap coverage and add a separate Ubuntu x64 DEB container job. The Ubuntu ARM64 job exercises its DEB, and Fedora x64/ARM64 container jobs exercise RPMs. These package container jobs run both the normal and setuid passes. The Ubuntu 24.04 ARM32 image has no desktop environment, so its artifact sanity job exercises only the CLI. Published sanity runs retain ARM32 desktop archive and DEB coverage on Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04, without the additional setuid sandbox pass.

### Pipeline Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|-----------|-------------|
|`buildQuality`|The quality of the build to test: "exploration", "insider", or "stable"|
|`buildCommit`|The published build commit SHA|
|`npmRegistry`|Custom NPM registry URL (optional)|

### Test Matrix

The pipeline tests across multiple platforms and architectures:

**Native Hosts:**

- macOS arm64
- Windows x64
- Windows arm64
- Ubuntu 22.04 x64 (native, with Snap support)

**Partial Support:**

For the following platforms only downloads are validated (and not install/runtime):

- macOS x64

**Linux Containers (amd64 and arm64):**

- Alpine 3.22
- CentOS Stream 9
- Debian 12 (also arm32) and Debian 13
- Fedora 42 and 43
- openSUSE Leap 16.0
- Red Hat UBI 9
- Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 (also arm32)

Debian 13 ARM32 is excluded because its time64 libraries do not satisfy the ARMHF DEB's legacy package dependencies. Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04 retain ARMHF desktop and package coverage pending removal of 32-bit ARM support.

### Pipeline Files

- [product-sanity-tests.yml](../../build/azure-pipelines/product-sanity-tests.yml) - Main pipeline definition
- [sanity-tests.yml](../../build/azure-pipelines/common/sanity-tests.yml) - Reusable job template

In the product build pipeline, the native Linux x64 sanity job excludes `desktop-linux-snap-x64` when `VSCODE_BUILD_LINUX_SNAP=false`, because no Snap artifact is built or published for that commit. Other native Linux sanity tests still run. With Snap building enabled, the job retains its full test selection.

### macOS Diagnostics

macOS jobs log the exact OS version/build, hardware configuration, memory pressure, swap usage,
VM page counters, and process memory rankings before dependency setup, before and after the tests,
and every minute while tests run. These snapshots help distinguish application regressions from
unhealthy build VMs even when the pool image name and Darwin kernel version have not changed.

Process rankings include memory footprint, compressed memory, RSS, and summed RSS by executable.
RSS sums can double-count shared pages and exclude compressed/nonresident memory; they are not
total physical usage. Only executable names are collected, not process arguments or environment
variables. Diagnostic commands have bounded execution times and report failures as warnings;
the monitored test command retains its exit status and the existing test timeouts.
